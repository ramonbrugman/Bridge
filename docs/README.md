# Welcome to Bridge.NET

!!!danger
Bridge.NET is no longer under active development. :cry:

We have a plan sketched out for a complete ground up reimplementation of Bridge, so we hope to pick things up again at some point in the future.

**Bridge.NET** is an open source C#-to-JavaScript Compiler. Write your application in C# and run on billions of devices.

||| C#
```csharp Write C# and compile with Bridge.NET
public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        var msg = "Hello, World!";

        Console.WriteLine(msg);
    }
}
```
||| JavaScript
```js Run in a web browser
Bridge.define("Demo.Program",
{
    main: function Main ()
    {
        var msg = "Hello, World!";

        System.Console.WriteLine(msg);
    }
});
```
|||

Run the sample above at [Deck.NET](https://deck.net/helloworld).

## TL;DR

* Read the [Getting Started](introduction/Getting_Started.md) Knowledge Base article
* Try [Deck.NET](https://deck.net/) if you want to play
* Installation:
  * Add **Bridge.NET** Visual Studio extension, or
  * Use [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/bridge) to install into a C# Class Library project (`Install-Package Bridge`), or
* The [Attribute Reference](attributes/Attribute_Reference.md) documentation is important
* The [Global Configuration](introduction/Global_Configuration.md) documentation is important

## Getting Started

If you are new to Bridge, a great place to start is reviewing the [Getting Started](introduction/Getting_Started.md) guide.

The easiest place to see Bridge in action is [Deck.NET](https://deck.net/).

[![Video Tutorial](static/youtube-template.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEUR1UthE2c)

## Sample

The following code sample demonstrates a simple `App.cs` class that will run automatically on page load and write a message to the Bridge Console.

```csharp Example ([Deck.NET](https://deck.net/7fb39e336182bea04c695ab43379cd8c))
public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
    }
}
```

The C# class above will be compiled into JavaScript and added to `/Bridge/ouput/demo.js` within your project. By default, Bridge will use the Namespace name as the file name. In this case: `demo.js`. There are many options to control the output of your JavaScript files, and the [Attribute Reference](attributes/Attribute_Reference.md) is important documentation to review.

```javascript
Bridge.define("Demo.Program", {
    main: function Main() {
        System.Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
    }
});
```

## Installation

A full list of installation options available at [https://bridge.net/download](https://bridge.net/download/), including full support for Visual Studio and Visual Studio Community on Windows, and Visual Studio Mac.

### Bridge for Visual Studio

If you're using Visual Studio for Windows, the easiest way to get started is by adding the Bridge.NET for Visual Studio [extension](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/dca5c80f-a0df-4944-8343-9c905db84757).

From within Visual Studio, go to the <kbd>Tools</kbd> > <kbd>Extensions and Updates...</kbd>.

![Bridge for Visual Studio](static/bridge-for-visual-studio.png)

From the options on the left side, be sure to select **Online**, then search for **Bridge**. Clicking **Download** will install Bridge for Visual Studio. After installation is complete, Visual Studio may require a restart.

![Visual Studio Extensions and Updates](static/visual-studio-extensions-and-updates.png)

Once installation is complete you will have a new **Bridge.NET** project type. When creating new Bridge enabled projects, select this project type.
### NuGet

Another option is installation of Bridge into a new **C# Class Library** project using [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/bridge). Within the NuGet Package Manager, search for **Bridge** and click to install.

Bridge can also be installed using the NuGet Command Line tool by running the following command:

```
Install-Package Bridge
```

More information regarding Nuget package installation for Bridge is available in the [Documentation](introduction/NuGet_Installation.md).
